## Disclaimer

These are PNGs, not ICNS, so it's one artifact for all sizes, but they still look great in the dock.

The graphics, original icons, logos they were created from belong to the company or individual who owns the application. I have no affiliation with them, and have no intention to gain anything from publishing these. Useing them is your own decision.
